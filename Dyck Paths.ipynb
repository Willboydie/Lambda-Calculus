    "## Dyck Path Method\n",
    "This method makes use of the class functionality and recursion to generate all the Dyck Paths of length n. Notice how the __init__ function within dyckpaths creates other instances of the class in a cascade, keeping __one_count__ and __zero_count__ balanced and less than __n__ for all instances of the class, but creating new instances whenever a path can either go up or down and still remain a valid Dyck Path. In this way, Python recursively finds every Dyck path, or 'function tree'. The __get_dyckpaths__ class function recursively traces the steps of each dyck path, and expresses them as lists of 1s and 0s ('step up' and 'step down' if thinking about Dyck Paths)."
