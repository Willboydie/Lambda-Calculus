# Lambda-Calculus
My final year mathematics double project had the title: 'A World of Functions: Python Coding the Lambda Calculus'. This was a solo project, overseen by a super visor and worked on soley by myself. The full report is upload in this repository as 'Î»_Calculus Project.pdf'. If henceforth I reference chapters and sections, I am referencing those within the report. A brief outline of the chapters:
						Chapter 1: 'Lambda Calculus'. An introduction to the syntax and its properties.
						Chapter 2: 'Booleans and the Integers'. We build the boolean and integer systems out of lambda functions.
						Chapter 3: 'SKI Calculus'. We introduce combinators 

### What is Lambda Calculus
Lambda calculus is just a functional notation at heart, however it is an ideal language in which to express mathematical systems made up purely of functions. Lambda functions are explained in great detail in Chapter 1: 'Lambda Calculus'. It turns out, lambda functions are universal, that is to say that we can express any mathematical object in terms of them (see Chapter 2, especially section 2.3).

### A note on SKI functions
SKI functions, describe the combinators S, K and I. For more, detailed information on what a combinator is, its properties and definitions for S, K and I, see Chapter 3: 'SKI Calculus'. It turns out that, just as lambda functions are universal, it can be proven that the three simple combinators S, K and I, make up a universal language.


### Aims of the Project
The main aim of the project was quite an open one: to explore and motivate this idea that lambda functions, and more specifically and emphatically S, K and I, can express any mathematical object
